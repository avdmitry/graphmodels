Recently I am interested in reinforcement learning and I also wanted to play with recurent neural networks for some time, after a bunch of image captioning papers were published. For both these models I found nice reference implementation on javascript from [Andrej Karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy): [recurrentjs](https://github.com/karpathy/recurrentjs) & [reinforcejs](https://github.com/karpathy/reinforcejs) and his useful article: [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/).

Initial code in general follows the code from two libraries above and its main purpose is to implement reference algorithms on C++.
